Human trafficking is a vice that has taken root and hold in the East African region, to be more specific in Kenya. This illicit trade has caused many families in this region endless heart ache and separation leading to a generation that is heavily traumatized and unable to cope with this trauma finally leading to degradation of lives in the form of depression and other factors that lead to suicide.

Miles to freedom is in existence because of the many saviors of human trafficking and child abuse that have no way of accessing any reprieve after going through such an ordeal. Miles to freedom is dedicated providing psycho-social support in the form of counseling and guidance of survivors as well as working with other partners in directing contributing to advocating for the rights and freedoms of every individual and child.

We work hard to restore confidence change lives and bring freedom to the vulnerable through working with like-minded individuals and organizations to stop trafficking and abuse of children and humans who are enslaved for the sole purpose of exploitation.
